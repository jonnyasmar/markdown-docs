# Story 1.6: Validation & Cleanup

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer working on the Markdown Docs VSCode extension,
**I want** to perform comprehensive validation and cleanup after the component reorganization,
**so that** the codebase is confirmed to work identically to before the migration with no functional regressions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All extension functionality works identically to pre-migration state
2. TypeScript compilation passes with zero errors or warnings
3. CSS styling renders correctly for all components  
4. Extension builds and packages successfully
5. Performance testing shows no degradation
6. Old empty directories are cleaned up (if any)
7. All import paths function correctly throughout the application
8. Complete functional regression testing passes

## Dev Notes

### Pre-Migration Baseline [Source: docs/project-cleanup-architecture.md#existing-project-analysis]
**Original Architecture State:**
- 10 total components (4,608 LOC)
- Flat directory structure under `webview-ui/src/components/`
- Single hook file in `webview-ui/src/hooks/`
- All functionality working correctly before migration

**Post-Migration Expected State:**
- Same 10 components reorganized into logical directory structure
- Same 1 hook file moved to `hooks/editor/` directory
- Zero functional changes - identical user experience
- Improved code organization and maintainability

### Comprehensive Test Matrix
**Component Category Testing:**

**UI Components (from Stories 1.3):**
- **Comments**: CommentItem, CommentList, CommentModal integration
- **Navigation**: TableOfContents functionality and navigation
- **Status**: StatusBar editor state display
- **Common**: ErrorBoundary error handling and recovery

**Editor Components (from Story 1.4):**
- **MermaidEditor**: Diagram creation, editing, real-time preview

**Plugin Components (from Story 1.5):**
- **CustomSearchPlugin**: Search within MDX content
- **SimplifiedAngleBracketPlugin**: Angle bracket character handling

**Hook Components (from Story 1.2):**
- **useEditorStatus**: Editor state management and StatusBar integration

### Critical Integration Points [Source: docs/project-cleanup-architecture.md#component-interaction-diagram]
**Component Flow Validation:**
```
App → CommentList → CommentItem → CommentModal
EditorApp → MDXEditorWrapper → [TableOfContents, StatusBar, MermaidEditor, Plugins]
StatusBar → useEditorStatus hook
ErrorBoundary wrapping main application
```

### Import Path Verification
**All Import Paths to Validate:**
- `App.tsx` → `./components/ui/comments/CommentList`
- `EditorApp.tsx` → `./components/ui/common/ErrorBoundary`  
- `MDXEditorWrapper.tsx` → `./components/ui/navigation/TableOfContents`
- `MDXEditorWrapper.tsx` → `./components/ui/status/StatusBar`
- `MDXEditorWrapper.tsx` → `./components/ui/comments/CommentModal`
- `MDXEditorWrapper.tsx` → `./components/editor/MermaidEditor`
- `MDXEditorWrapper.tsx` → `./components/plugins/CustomSearchPlugin`
- `MDXEditorWrapper.tsx` → `./components/plugins/SimplifiedAngleBracketPlugin`
- `CommentList.tsx` → `./CommentItem` (relative within comments directory)
- `StatusBar.tsx` → `../../hooks/editor/useEditorStatus`

### Performance Baseline Validation [Source: docs/project-cleanup-architecture.md#compatibility-requirements]
**Performance Impact Requirement:** Zero performance impact - only file location changes

**Performance Metrics to Monitor:**
- Extension activation time
- Markdown document loading speed
- Component rendering performance
- Memory usage during typical workflows
- Build time and package size

### Success Criteria Definition [Source: docs/project-cleanup-architecture.md#success-criteria]
**Complete Success Requirements:**
- All components relocated to logical directory structure
- All import paths updated and functional
- All existing functionality preserved exactly
- TypeScript compilation clean
- Extension builds and runs identically to before

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Comprehensive manual testing of all extension functionality
- Systematic verification of each migrated component
- Performance baseline comparison
- Build and deployment process validation

**Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- **Regression Testing**: Every feature that worked before migration must work identically after
- **Integration Testing**: All component interactions must function exactly as before
- **Performance Testing**: No measurable performance degradation allowed
- **Build Testing**: Complete build and packaging pipeline must work flawlessly

**Critical Test Scenarios:**
1. **Complete User Workflow**: Open markdown file → edit content → use comments → navigate with TOC → view status
2. **Mermaid Integration**: Create and edit Mermaid diagrams within markdown content
3. **Search Functionality**: Use search plugin to find content within documents
4. **Error Handling**: Trigger errors and verify ErrorBoundary catches them correctly
5. **Extension Lifecycle**: Install → activate → use → deactivate → uninstall

### Rollback Strategy [Source: docs/project-cleanup-architecture.md#rollback-strategy]
**Rollback Method:** Git revert to previous commit, rebuild extension package
**Risk Mitigation:** Systematic testing after each migration phase completed in Stories 1.1-1.5
**Monitoring:** Manual testing of all functionality after reorganization

### Risk Assessment [Source: docs/project-cleanup-architecture.md#phase-6-validation-cleanup]
- **Risk Level:** Validation Phase - Comprehensive Testing Required
- **Scope:** Complete application functionality verification  
- **Critical Requirement:** Zero functional regressions allowed
- **Success Definition:** Extension works identically to pre-migration state
